# Mobius Robotics

Welcome to **Mobius Robotics**, the robotics team of the University of Palermo! Founded by Alice Matranga and Gabriele Azza, our team is dedicated to innovation, collaboration, and pushing the boundaries of robotics technology.

## Our Robots

### 1. Loki
**Loki** is our competitor for the Eurobot 2024 competition. We are finalizing Loki as a robust platform to study and implement ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). Loki serves as the foundation for several key repositories:
- [loki_firmware](https://github.com/Mobius-Robotics/loki_firmware)
- [loki_hw_interface](https://github.com/Mobius-Robotics/loki_hw_interface)
- [loki_description](https://github.com/Mobius-Robotics/loki_description)

### 2. Eurobot 2025
We are currently in the planning stages for our **Eurobot 2025** competition robot. Stay tuned for updates as we design and develop our next-generation competitor!

### 3. Spazz.ino
**Spazz.ino** is our autonomous robot designed to keep the University of Palermo campus clean. Equipped with advanced navigation and cleaning capabilities, Spazz.ino works tirelessly to maintain a spotless environment for all students and staff.
